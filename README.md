# 🐧 A Bit of Background on Linux

Linux is a **free and open-source operating system kernel** first developed by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991. Over time, it became the foundation for hundreds of **Linux distributions** used across desktops, servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems.

## 📌 What is Linux?

Linux itself is just a **kernel**—the core part of the operating system that manages hardware. To become a full OS, it's bundled with software like GNU tools, shells, and graphical interfaces. Together, they form a **Linux distribution** (or "distro").

> Linux powers everything from **supercomputers and smartphones** to **cloud platforms** and **ethical hacking labs**.
